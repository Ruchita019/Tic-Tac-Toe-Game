# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game focusing on strategic thinking, problem-solving, and spatial reasoning. Whether it's doodled on a piece of paper during a break at school, drawn on a beach during summer vacation, or played on a digital screen, Tic-tac-toe's universal appeal endures. It has proven to be an excellent game that transcends cultural and generational boundaries, creating cherished memories and connections through the ages.

In this project, I have developed a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using **Python Basics**. It is designed to be played by two players. The game incorporates various functions to handle different tasks, such as:

1. Creating a board to display the game grid.
2. Generating markers ('X' and 'O') and allowing players to make choices.
3. Checking for all possible winning combinations on the board.
4. Determining which player gets the first turn.
5. Verifying if there are any empty spaces left on the board.
6. Checking if the entire grid is filled, resulting in a draw.
7. Allowing players to mark their chosen positions on the board.
8. Implementing a restart function to play the game again.

Now that all the necessary functions are in place, the game code is ready to be executed.
